        <p>Here is a time-line for the life of Thomas Edison: </p>
        <h3 class="sections">Childhood & Early Life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Born to Samuel Ogden Edison, Jr and Nancy Matthews Elliott, Thomas Edison was the 
            youngest of the seven children of the couple. While his father was an exiled political 
            activist, his mother was employed as a teacher.</li>
      
            <li>Interestingly, young Edison received his formal education for just 12 weeks.
              Thereafter, it was his mother who took the responsibility of teaching him at home.
              A voracious reader, he read a wide range of subjects and soon developed the habit
              of self-education.
            </li>
      
            <li>During his early years, he sold newspapers to passengers travelling along the Grand
              Trunk Railroad line. The access to up-to-date information led him to start off his own
              newspaper, Grand Trunk Herald, which became quite a hit with the masses. It was his
              first of the many more to come business ventures.
            </li>
      
            <li>
              In addition to selling newspapers, he set up a small laboratory and conducted chemical
              experiments in one of the baggage cars of the train. Unfortunately, one experiment went
              wrong and resulted in the car catching fire. This temporarily ended his pursuits.
            </li>
      
            <li>
              A good deed of saving the life of an infant from a near-tragic incident changed his life
              forever. The indebted dad of the child trained him as a telegraph operator. He found his
              first job at Strafford Junction, Ontario.
            </li>
      
            <li>
              He travelled all through the Midwest, working for various companies, before finding a job 
              the Associated Press bureau news wire. However, he was soon fired due to conducting experiments
              during working hours. 
            </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3 class="sections">Careers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            He moved to New York, where he began his career as an inventor. One of his earliest invention was 
            a stock ticker. Impressed by working of the machine, the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company offered 
            him $40,000 for the rights. In 1869, he patented the electric vote recorder, his first in a long 
            list to follow.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            He then relocated to Newark, New Jersey, where he set up a small laboratory and employed machinist.
            The decades of 1870s was devoted to conducting experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric 
            railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            He expanded his operation and moved to Menlo Park, New Jersey. The one invention that brought him 
            his first round of fame and catapulted his status to greater heights was the phonograph, invented 
            in 1877. The device assisted in recording sound but had loopholes due to which he continued to work
            on it until the next decades when the <q>Perfected Phonograph</q> was finally made available.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            The financial gain from selling the quadruplex telegraph to Western Union not only helped him achieve
            his first monetary success, but assisted him in setting up the laboratory of Menlo Park for acheiving
            greater technological advancements and innovation.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            In 1877, he invented the carbon microphone used in telephones, radio broadcasting and public address
            works.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            Moving further, he worked on electric bulb, which had been the object of study of various inventors 
            earlier. He is credited with inventing the first commercially pratical incadenscent light, devoid
            of all the flaws that the earlier invented bulbs possessed.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            In 1878, he formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City. The following year, he demonstrated
            his incandescent light bulb for the first time. The first commercial application of the bulb was in Columbia,
            the new streamer of Oregon railroad and Navigation Company.  
          </li>
      
          <li>
            In 1880, after attaining the patent for the light bulb, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, with a
            motive of delivering electricity to provide power and light the cities of the world.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            The company's first investor owned utility was set up at Pearl Street Station. The unit was involved with
            generating 110 volts direct current to 59 customers. In 1883, Roselle,New Jersey, witnessed the first 
            standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            By 1887, there were about 121 power stations established by the US that delivered electricity to customers.
            The other inventions that he worked upon during this time were fluoroscopy, two-way telegraph, kinetoscope,
            and so on.
          </li>
      
          <li>
           He then initiated an industrial research laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, which formed the base of the
           primary research laboratory for the Edison lighting companies. 
          </li>
      
          <li>
            It was at the laboratory in West Orange that he worked on the devlopment of the lighting technology, prefected
            the phonograph, developed motion picture camera and established the alkaline storage battery.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            At the turn of the century, he soon transformed himself from being an inventor to an industrialist and business
            manager. The key work that he indulged in during this time was developing a suitable storage battery that could
            power an electric car. 
          </li>
      
          <li>
            The first designed self-starter battery was for Model T for Henry Ford, a friend and admirer. The invention was a
            grand success and was extensively used until decades later by the automobile industry.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            He was made the head of the Naval Consulting Board during World War I. A profound advocator of non-violence, he
            indulged in projects that basically designed defensive weapons, such as submarine detectors and gun-location 
            techniques.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            His last patent, which was his 1093rd US patent, was an apparatus for holding objects during the electroplating
            process. 
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3 class="sections">Major Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            He is credited with 1093 US patents and is accredited with numerous invention that contributed greatly in mass
            communications and telecommunications. Amongst his long list of discoveries, the most notable ones are stock
            ticker, phonograph, first pratical electric light bulb, motion picture camera, mechanical vote reader and a
            battery for an electric car.
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3 class="sections">Awards and Achievements</h3>

            fair and the National Academy of Sciences.
          </li>
      
          <li>
            He received various medals including John Scott Medal, Edward Longstreth Medal, John Fritz Medal, Franklin Medal
            and Edison Medal. His birthday is marked as National Inventor's Day.
          </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3 class="sections">Personal Life and Legacy</h3>
        <ul>

            He married twice in his lifetime. His first marriage was to <em>Mary Stilwell</em> in 1871, who bore him three children. 
            After the tragic death of his wife in 1884, he tied the knot for the second time two years to <em>Mina Miller</em>. The
            couple had three children.
          </li>

          </li>
      
          <li>
              His death was mourned by people across the globe, who dimmed or turned off their electrical power to commemorate his death.
          </li>
        
          <li>
            To pay a tribute to the contributions made by this illustritous inventor, several schools, colleges, institutions, museums, 
            memorials, parks, buildings and bridges have been named after him. Out of these, the most notable is the town of Edison, 
            New Jersey which bears his name.
